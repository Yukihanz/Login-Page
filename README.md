# Info
Sing in/Sign up is built using React Rite. The page is serverless meaning all the requests are made by the client. the requests to sign up and sign in are made in `handleRequest.js`, the accounts username and password are stored within a object in `accounts.js`. Both files are located in `src/assets/components/sign_page`.
